            <p> When Star was settled it was one of the first locations in the Treasure Valley. One of the first settlers was Ben F. Swalley in 1863. After him others came and set up their homes along the Boise river. These early homes helped those who were traveling by providing food and lodging. The first schoolhouse was built in the 1870‚Äôs. When the school house was finished someone sawed out a star and nailed it to the school. This star became a landmark for travelers. This is how the town got the name Star.</p>

            <p>In 1905 Star established city limits with 4 miles in every direction. During the 1900‚Äôs the town grew rapidly. They got a mayor, marshal, constable, and justice of the peace. Star was growing rapidly during this time and the population reached over 500 people. This made it the second-largest community in the Treasure Valley. </p>

            <p>The area around the Boise river provided the star with a good irrigation system. One of the earliest systems was the Pioneer Canal that was built in the 1860s. The different irrigation systems and ditches supplied Star with their water sources. This also allowed Middleton and Star to be settled early. This land also provided good soil from crops like alfalfa, sugar beets, and grains such as wheat and oats.</p>

            <p>In the early 1900s business continued as they erected 30 new buildings. These buildings include an opera house, a church, Cracker Barrel store, and a cheese factory. There was also a newspaper service that was provided during 1911-1920. It was about Star, Eagle and Middleton. Star's growth did decrease around 1929. The population stayed around 500 people until its increase in the 2000s. </p>
